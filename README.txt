The only prerequisites its that you have a functional version of Net Balancer and that Net Blancer tray is running in the background.
You will also have to go into the autohotkey macro and change the file location of the .xml files and Net Balancer 'nbcmd.exe" file, so that they match the location of where they are stored on your computer.
